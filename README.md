# Devkit-Static

A Sass project boilerplate, using Gulp4 and BrowserSync. Ideal for building static webpages.

### Prerequisites

To use Devkit-Static you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

### Installing

Download the .zip file and extract the content into your working directory.

Now run:

```
npm install
```

After all the packages are installed run:

```
npm start
```

In your working directory a dist directory will be automatically generated. All your work should be done in the src directory. On every file save in the src directory, *.scss will get compiled into style.min.css, *js into app.min.js. All the images get transferred automatically into the dist directory.
The dist forder is constantly whatched. Don't touch it!

You are now all set.
Happy Dev!
